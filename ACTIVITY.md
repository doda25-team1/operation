### Week Q2.1 (Nov 13+)
- Deon: https://github.com/doda25-team1/app/pull/3, https://github.com/doda25-team1/model-service/pull/3
I worked on the F8 task of A1, implementing automated versioning and GitHub workflows for both the app and backend. I explored ways to extract versions directly from pom.xml and pyproject.toml, and set up automated image building and pushing. I also added a mechanism to automatically bump the version after each successful workflow run.
- Nicolas: https://github.com/doda25-team1/model-service/pull/1
I worked on creating the docker file, upgraded it to contain 2 stages, created PORT as an enviromental variable and allowed for multi-arhitecture compatibility. Therefore satisfying F3,F4 (for the model-service) and F5,F6.
